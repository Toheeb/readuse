# ReadUse
> ## ðŸš§ This project is under development. ðŸš§
>  
>  Born out of a personal adventure. The progress, and direction of this project will be based on the Guides I write towards the styling needs of [my website](https://toheeb.com), where I use it live.

> I'm designing this in public. You can follow along on Twitter at [@toheebdotcom](https://twitter.com/toheebdotcom).

## Why ReadUse?
When styling websites, we **repeatedly** do the following to make content readable and useable. 
- maintain aesthetics such as the hierarchy of spacing, font sizes, etc.
- lay content multidimensionally. From n-column layout to sticky footer components.

I call these Functional Styles. Every website needs them. And ReadUse abstracts these styles so you can focus on making your designs unique, through your awesome creativity!


## How ReadUse compares to other CSS Frameworks?
Here's how it compares to Reset stylesheets, Component, Utility or Classless CSS frameworks:

- Instead of using reset stylesheets, you can enjoy having aesthetic styles
- If you worry about your design looking Bootstrap(py) or Tailwind(y). ReadUse won't interfere with your creativity.
- Rather than minimal designs with Classless Frameworks, you get a lot more!

## Expectations
There're 2 parts to expect:
- Drop-and-use stylesheet for good looking and operable webpage contents (current focus)
- Layout utility stylesheet for  multidimensional contents

NB: Both will be customizable with design principles intact.

## Usage
ReadUse is in its initial development. I only use it in production because it's an adventure for me. I get to prioritize features progressively.

### via CDN
You can load the CSS file via JSDELIVR or UNPKG. Watch out for the version. `0.1.0` loads an "hello world" CSS file (see the `body` styles)

#### JSDELIVR
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/readuse@0.1.0/dist/css/readuse.min.css

#### UNPKG
https://unpkg.com/readuse@0.1.0/dist/css/readuse.min.css

### via Package Manager

### NPM
```npm install readuse```

### Yarn
```yarn add readuse```

---

After installation, you can import the CSS file into your project if you're using a file loader:

```@import 'readuse/dist/css/readuse.css```

Otherwise, just link to it via

```./node_modules/readuse/dist/css/readuse.css```

## How to Contribute
This adventure project is inspired and depends on the guides I write on toheeb.com. 

I'll be using Issues to discuss the features. **You can contribute by sharing your view in the comment section of each feature.**
